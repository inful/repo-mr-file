# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.7
#
# Image for repo-mr-file, consumed by GoReleaser dockers_v2.
#
# GoReleaser pre-builds the binaries for every target platform and lays
# them out under <workdir>/<TARGETPLATFORM>/<binary> in the build
# context. This Dockerfile only does the final COPY + labels; it does
# NOT build Go code itself (see goreleaser.yaml warning "Don't build
# binaries in your Dockerfile" for why we avoid that).
#
# Multi-arch notes:
#   - $TARGETPLATFORM is the runtime platform the image is built for;
#     buildx resolves it at build time per architecture.
#   - The base image (distroless/static-debian) is a manifest list, so
#     buildx pulls the right arch variant automatically.
#
# Runtime base:
#   - gcr.io/distroless/static-debian:nonroot ships ca-certificates
#     (required for TLS to GitHub/GitHub Enterprise/GitLab/Gitea) and
#     nothing else. Runs as uid 65532 by default.

# OCI labels are written by GoReleaser at build time (see
# .goreleaser.yaml dockers_v2.annotations), so this Dockerfile stays
# free of build-arg sprawl and works identically for any tag/version.

# OCI exec form so the binary gets argv[0] rather than "sh -c".
